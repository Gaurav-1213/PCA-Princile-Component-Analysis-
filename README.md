# PCA-Principal-Component-Analysis-
Principal component analysis is one technique used to take a large list of interconnected variables and choose the ones that best suit a model. This process of focusing in on only a few variables is called dimensionality reduction, and helps reduce complexity of our dataset. At its root, principal component analysis summarizes data.Principal component analysis is performed by considering all of our variables and calculating a set of direction and magnitude pairs (vectors) to represent them.
